# info on environments

We used 3 different environments.

## DINCAE (Python)

This used older Python and tensorflow.

## Tensorflow Pangeo 

This was a 2025 pangeo ML image. Environment from `conda export` is in tensorflow.yml.

## Data processing.

This really just needed xarray, zarr, numpy but we used the py-rocket-geospatial image.
